step1: rpstbln of 3000 assembled datasets against 2000 selected viral CDD domains - under scripts: rpstbln.sh combined with scripts/virus_models.txt
step2a: get statistical information on output of rpstbln: post_analysis/jupyter_notebook 
step2b: scripts convert output from rpstbln into workable dataformat for taxonomy domain team: post_analysis/scripts/add_samp_column.py 
step3: grab protein fasta's corresponding to viral CDD domains used in step 1 - download URL in scripts/mash_sketch.sh
step4: mash sketch these fastas -scripts/mash_sketch.sh
step5: mash sketch assembled contigs - scripts/mash_sketch.sh
step6: calculate mash dist between ref and query - scripts/mash_sketch.sh
step7: compare outputs of rpstbln and mash outputs -  : post_analysis/jupyter_notebook
