step1: rpstbln of 3000 assembled datasets against 2000 selected viral CDD domains
step2: get statistical information on output of rpstbln
step3: grab protein fasta's corresponding to viral CDD domains used in step 1
step4: mash sketch these fastas
step5: mash sketch assembled contigs
step6: calculate mash dist between ref and query
step7: compare outputs of rpstbln and mash outputs
