Notes from presentation Day 2

Basically all of the short read sets have been assembled now, but ~50% of reads were not assembled, and aligned with very conservative algorithm (Skesa)

We will scan with viral subset of CDD on short read data

Since the output after scanning contigs with CDDs includes the read ID, we can use the contig nucleotide sequence to “classify” to levels below family/subfamily

Ben’s suggestion: Split the raw read data; scan with HMMs; use results as training data for MinHash and extract kmers that are indicative of virus/viral tax group; use thos kmers to scan the other set of raw data

Mike? suggested: Use the 86k contigs, sort by contigs with highest coverage to identify the read sets with highest potential, then look for CDDs in them
