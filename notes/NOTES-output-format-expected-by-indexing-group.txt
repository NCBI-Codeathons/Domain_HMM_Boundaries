Indexing group requested the following output format:

1 tab-delimited line per hit, with the following 6 fields:
<sraid> <seqid> <domainid> <seqstart> <seqstop> <score>

<sraid>: name of SRA assembly/dataset
<seqid>: sequence name
<domainid>: CDD/profile name
<seqstart>: start nucleotide position in <seqid> of hit
<seqstop>:  stop nucleotide position in <seqid> of hit
<score>: 'score' of hit 

<seqstart> < <seqstop> implies hit is on positive/forward strand
<seqstart> > <seqstop> implies hit is on negative/reverse strand

If <seqstart> == <seqstop> then strand is unknown but in practice this
should never happen given a reasonable score threshold
